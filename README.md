# covcomp

This is an R package for implementing the covariance completion algorithm in [1]. The variable `Cov` is a discretization of the partial covariance $K_{立}$ in the form of a matrix and `Omega` is a matrix of 1s and 0s of the same dimensions as `Cov` which describes the domain 立 of K_{立}.

1. For manual choice of truncation parameters used in the algorithm:
```
Compln(Cov, Omega, VectorOfTuning) 
```
Here `VectorOfTuning` is a vector of integers which serve as truncation parameters in the matrix multiplication involved. Naturally, the length of this vector should be at least *m-1* when we are dealing with an *m*-serrated domain 立.

2. For automatic choice of truncation parameters in accordance with the fraction of variance explained (FVE) criterion:
```
ComplnFVE(Cov, Omega, FVE) 
```
